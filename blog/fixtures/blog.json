        "post": "## [Debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt)\r\n\r\n\r\nRight. I'd like to talk about technical debt. \r\n\r\nSo, we, as developers, but more generally at the company I work, have a problem.\r\n\r\nIn fact it has been an issue for most of my carer so far, in most of the companies that I've worked at or for and it has a name...\r\n\r\n###**Technical debt**\r\n\r\nIf you don't already know what technical debt is, it's essentially the cost to the department caused by old code.\r\n\r\nThe cost it would take to upgrade, the cost associated with maintaining, fixing the current code base.\r\n\r\nIn other words the work needed to get more work done. It needs to be paid at some point, but in the mean time it often seems much easier (and cheaper) to hack and bodge the current code base.\r\n\r\nThis sadly adds to the technical debt, and delays the inevitable.\r\n\r\nDescribing technical debt to non-IT colleges is often tricky. \r\n\r\nIf they see someone else can do what they want in less time (due to less technical debt) they don't understand why a larger complex system would take more time to adapt.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue with this is (I suspect) that debt isn't well understood by... I'm going to go with, **anyone**.\r\n\r\nThat might be a little excessive, but people see debt differently depending on their outlook on life and experiences with it so far.\r\n\r\nPersonally I hate being in debt, I avoid it as much as I can but it's a fact of life.\r\n\r\nMost debt is more like an investment in the future, provided things carry on the way they currently are you expect to reduce the debt slowly overtime.\r\n\r\nTechnical debt isn't really any different, think of it work needed to be done before more should be added and I suspect you'll be in a much better position.\r\n\r\nStill...\r\n\r\nI'd like to propose another term.\r\n\r\n## Distance\r\n\r\nAllow me to elaborate...\r\n\r\nEveryone has experience with distance, and the terms are much simpler.\r\n\r\nWe are quite \"far\" (as I see it) from the code we work with day-to-day. \r\n\r\n* We didn't write large chunks of it.\r\n* It's not well documented.\r\n* Most of it was written ~10 years ago and the web has moved on **a lot** in 10 years. \r\n* Paradigms have shifted in that time to allow different approaches to development\r\n* We haven't had time to train new developers in it.\r\n* Significant parts are compiled propriety code which we can't change (but can decompile...).\r\n\r\nThe idea of us being quite far aware from the code as it once was, shouldn't be that difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nWhat we've been taught and learnt in that time, our opinions of what good code should be, how it should look and how it should behave have changed.\r\n\r\nTechnical debt is horrible and makes work much more complicated than it has to be. \r\n\r\nIt's also a fact of life, it happens whether you want it to or not, like the tide coming in and the sun rising.\r\n\r\nI'm not (can't) propose a solution to technical debt, only hopefully a better way to explain it.",

        "post": ">\u201cAnd folks, let\u2019s be honest. Sturgeon was an optimist. Way more than 90% of code is crap.\u201d \u2014 Al viro\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm quite opinionated (in general) but especially when it comes to programming languages.\r\nSomeone recently suggested to find languages I don't like you'd do a \"Select * from languages\"....\r\n\r\nWhilst I feel that isn't fair, I've been quite vocal about my dislike for the languages I tend to use on a day to day basis. \r\n\r\n* Java\r\n* Javascript\r\n* Php\r\n\r\nI feel like in a way that list should be self explanatory, but quite a few people I've spoken to simply don't understand what possible issue I could have with any of those languages.\r\n\r\n## Javascript\r\n\r\nI know this is a controversial opinion (heh), but I don't like JavaScript.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying it's not fun to write, I'm not saying it isn't powerful, it is, but it's not a \"nice\" language. \r\n\r\nOptional syntax (I'm looking at you semi-colons) can introduce bugs that would only exist in JavaScript and lead to quite funny (if a little disappointing) exchanges like [this](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/3057).\r\n\r\nNo support for inheritance in objects (without hacky workarounds).\r\n\r\n[Callbacks](http://callbackhell.com/).\r\n\r\nBut honestly my biggest complaint with JavaScript is it makes it easy to write bad code.\r\n\r\nLike Perl, a famously \"write-only language\".\r\n\r\nEveryone speaks it, many don't do so well, this is less of a problem when the code it's self is concise and easy to read and some javascript is those things.\r\n\r\nIt's often the simple things like not using \"var\" makes variables global that can lead to you pulling your hair out for hours, only to discover the solution was right in front of you.\r\n\r\nHuge libraries are written to make life easier for developers (jQuery!) which add what should be standard functionality and this is a Good Thing.\r\n\r\nBut they also change the syntax (or at least appear to), there is less cohesion, and more weird javascript.\r\n\r\nBut as it stands JavaScript isn't really going anywhere, as it has nowhere to go. \r\n\r\n(Cheers node.js)\r\n\r\nNothing is likely to replace it as an in browser client-side scripting language, even if there have been some valiant attempts. \r\n\r\nSo we build upon it, and hide it under layers of Coffee/ClosureScript, Dart ... the list goes on.\r\n\r\nI'm still going to use it, but I'll curse every time I encounter a syntax error that could've been avoided.\r\n\r\nOr I need to add or remove anything from an array. \r\n\r\nOr I need to do something async.\r\n\r\nOr I need to use something resembling an object.\r\n\r\nOr I need to run it on IE.\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n\r\nI'd love to rant about this for hours on end. It was my second language, and easily the one I've written the most code in, usually without Maven, which honestly makes dependency management better than vanilla Java, which is astonishing given how much of a ball ache Maven is.\r\n\r\nJava should be nice, it avoids all the problems I have with Javascript, enforcing types explicit comparisons.... and yet... I don't get on with it.\r\n\r\nThe strict inheritance rules (NO MIXIN'S FOR YOU) and the needlessly complex access rules make it a pain to modify or maintain anyone else's code.\r\n\r\nI'm sure anyone that's used it has encountered a third party library that was so close to being wonderfully useful, but either won't let you access the source (Grrr) or *almost* gives you access to a very useful feature but sadly you're not part of that package and it's protected.\r\n\r\nThis might seem a little petty, but I think it's the kind of thing that causes hacks and annotations to be added to the language to allow it's users to complete what I'd consider to be quite simple things. \r\n\r\nAnyone that's seen a complex hibernate or spring (or god forbid both combined) has felt that pain.\r\n\r\nWorse when you're in a team with some people using annotations some Plain-Old-Java and some XML.\r\n\r\nIt's like someone brought up a list of the worst ways to configure things and tried to combine them all.\r\n\r\nI'm also quite a big fan of [these reasons](http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/OO_programming/why_oo_sucks)\r\n\r\n[Groovy is madness compounded.](http://svn.codehaus.org/groovy/trunk/groovy/groovy-core/src/main/org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/ArrayUtil.java)\r\n\r\n(I like Clojure though, haven't used it for much, yet)\r\n\r\n## PHP\r\n\r\nI can't get it any better than [this guy](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-php-singularity/)\r\n\r\n... But I do hear it's getting better.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I'll stick to my preferred languages, as much as I can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Clothes strewn across the ground a split glass of water slowly sank into the floor boards and the hint of damp wood teased at his nostrils. He could taste last night on his breath.\r\n\r\nA familiar dulled taste of beer, spirits and the cotton wool affect of having smoked too much. His lungs and throat hurt, and he croaked a curse into the moted light filtering through his tattered curtains from the previous tenant.\r\nAn off putting purple that seem incongruous compared to the rest of the room, in shades of grey and green.\r\n\r\nHe picked up the spilled glass at his feet and coaxed the final drops out into his parched mouth.\r\nLooking back into his bed clothes he saw them strewn around as if he had been fighting some dark creatures prone all night.\r\n\r\nDejected he stumbled through his door to the kitchen and put a kettle on his cooker and lit the gas with the lighter still in his pocket from the previous night.

        "post": ">**Xan** \r\nlooked about the shop, checked the time and decided it was more than past time to close. Fumbling for the the key in his jacket he put the key on the desk. He took a quick stock check, only a few people had been into his shop today and most hadn't stayed very long. A small group of overly inquisitive students had briefly stopped by poked and prodded a few things lying around. His barely veiled contempt had seen them off soon enough after they asked too many questions. His philosophy as far as his shop and workshop was as such; if you didn't know what you were looking for, you were in the wrong place. Perhaps not the most open, friendly or even good business practice. However for the most part his shop was a side show for when other revenue streams ran short, his various contracts and projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe replaced the delicate machines and old books to their proper places on their shelves, replaced the price labels and dusted them half heartedly to remove the finger prints. Feeling that at least the shop was tidy enough, he turned to the desk. He checked the cash in draw, the receipts of a few trinkets sold. Nothing much nut he still had a few more adventurous orders for clients in the cellar. Some nice projects he had yet to get his teeth into, things that required planning. They would keep him afloat financially at least for the time being. \r\n\r\n\r\nHe sat in his old leather chair and stroked the cracks in the leather, the comforting smell of the end of the day, old leather and stale cigarettes rushing up to meet his grateful nostrils. He put his feet in the bin, a favourite resting place just the right height for relaxing and removed his tobacco and papers from one of  the pockets in his coat. A long practised routine produced a thin, albeit slightly bent cigarette, with only a light sprinkling of tobacco on his person. He brushed it to the floor and placed the freshly made cigarette gently between his lips, replacing his equipment somewhere in his coat. He stood slowly walked to the entrance to the workshop, hardly still a door but bearing a resemblence and locked it, then retreated to the workshop, picking up the cash from the register and placing the notes in a safe under the desk. With a last scanning look around the shop, to ensure he didn\u2019t lock an unusually quiet, prone or camouflaged customer he turned off the light and exited through the front door, pulling the blinds down on the way. He hurriedly locked up and pulled his coat tight around him to ward off the cold wind down the street and with a quick glance to a near-by flickering street lamp began his journey home.\r\n\r\nHe walked quickly down the street, although not in any rush, with his eyes fixed almost permanently on his boots, offering a brief glance at any noises of merriment from around any local pubs. The smoke from his mouth occasionally stung at his eyes, but despite the slight wincing it caused he refused to remove his hands from their pockets. A skill he\u2019d learnt long a go served well to both feed his habit and prevent he hands from freezing. Locals and travellers alike found kinship in glasses and bottles as the evening rolled around. A liquid comradeship as facts and fictions were passed between mouths and awaiting ears whilst flirtations with winks and smiles exchanged between men and women alike. He wished to join and paused to watch briefly as he felt an argument flicker inside.\r\n\r\n\r\n>\"Just one? ... Mayb- No.\u201d \r\n\r\n\r\nTonight he had to head home in order to back ready for work the next day. As he exited the main street, occasionally dodging a carriage on its way into the night he pulled a lighter from his trousers and light the cigarette he'd been passing along his lips, having gone out whilst he pondered an ale and took a long satisfying breath. Adjusting his fingerless gloves to ward off as much of the cold as he could, when his hands had to face to cold, he headed to cross the park to get to his residence.\r\n\r\nOnce in the park his pace slacked, here he could enjoy his walk, admire the silhouettes of the park and city by a hunter\u2019s moon and breathe deeply of the closest he could get to country air, moisture and foliage, without (most of) the muck.  Behind him, casually propping up the park gates a hooded stranger stood, unnoticed by Xan, but the figure had noticed him. The figure watched him pass with what could almost pass as a casual glance, if his eyes could have been seen, but more than a casual glance was taken. The figure's hand stroked his hair back from his eyes, without dislodging his hood and he bent slowly, his left hand outstretched before him as if he had dropped something to the ground. The figure's head darted about and his right hand shot into his jacket then out again, it\u2019s fingers twitching wildly. It calmed and supported his weight as he sunk to a crouch. If Xan had turned to look, the figure now looked almost invisible, a deeper shadow to the foliage of the park behind him.\r\n\r\nXan, was oblivious muttering to himself about the cold as he removed a hip-flask from some hidden pocket, unscrewed the lid and took a swig to ward against the cold the taste of a warming spirit, flavoured with ginger. Having decided the bracing wind might speed his return to an, as yet unlit, warm fire in his flat he removed his coat and slung it over his arm and quickened his pace. The figure behind him silently twitched; the hood fell from their head and their hands dug into the dirt. Xan fumbled the flask into his trousers and tried to check his time-piece in the moonlight. \r\n>The figure behind him leapt.",
